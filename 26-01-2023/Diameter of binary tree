Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.
The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3

class Solution {
    int res=0;
    public int DiameterHeight(TreeNode root){
        if(root==null) return 0;
        int lh= DiameterHeight(root.left);
        int rh= DiameterHeight(root.right);
        res=Math.max(res,lh+rh);
        return 1+Math.max(lh,rh);
    }
    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        DiameterHeight(root);
        return res;
        
    }
}
